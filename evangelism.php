				<h2>Evangelism</h2>
				
					<p>
				        What is Evangelism? Do we really understand Evangelizing for God?
                        Do I really understand what working for God means?
                        Look at it like this, "Is what you're doing, would that please Jesus?
                        Everything we do should be an example of what He would do!
                        We all get excited when we read the Bible and once we start to understand it,
                        want to tell the world about a verse that we read and how that verse will help
                        them.
                        Well, these things are good, and one thing that will lead us to Jesus is reading
                        the Bible, which, brings us to: EVANGELISM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It says in the Book of Acts 2:1 "When the day of Pentecost came, they were all
                        together in one place".
                        With the activities we do, this is bringing people together. Bring them together
                        and Jesus will do the rest.
                        Doing different types of activities, we can invite people, let people choose what
                        they want. God doesn't in the Bible, ever tell us what we have to do! In life we
                        always have the choice of doing what we want to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We plan:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Revivals and/or Rekindling of the Spirit. This is a three night event. We have
                                special music, different ministers speaking and this is a time of renewing your mind, your
 	                            thoughts.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Community Involvement. We are planning a Community picnic this summer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Door Hangers. We use this as a time to let community residents know what
                                E.U.M.C. activities are going on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Softball & Home Made Ice Cream. This is a great time to fellowship.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Movie Night. There are some good "Christian" movies out there.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Website. We up date and maintain E.U.M.C. website.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Psalm 133:1 says; "How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity".  Is that the meaning of
                        Evangelism? Is a club for kids that are not qualified to be in the actual youth group.  This club prepares the
                        younger kids to go into the youth group by still keeping it fun and entertaining.
