					<h3>Sunday Schedule</h3>
						<p>Worship at EUMC (which begins at 10:00 each Sunday morning) is traditional but spontaneous, featuring art, drama, and special music in addition to the beloved hymns and prayers of the church.  <a href="leadership.php">Pastor David</a> and Pastor Sarah lead the service, assisted by volunteers who read scripture, offer the Children's Message, and share other gifts with the congregation.   Music is led by the Chancel Choir, directed by Jennifer Jones.</p>

						<p>We have Sunday School classes for all ages, which meet at 9:00.  We also offer a number of other Christian education opportunities throughout the week.
</p>

				<div id="belief"></div>
					<h3>Worship</h3>
						<p>We celebrate the sacrament of Holy Communion once per month and offer special celebrations throughout the year.  Recent services have included a tribute to veterans on Memorial Day, recognition of high school and college graduates, and the 25th Reunion of <a href="preschool.php">Genesis Preschool</a>.</p>
					

					<div id="pastor"></div>
					<h3>How to Join</h3>
					<p>At EUMC we believe that involvement in a local faith community is an important way to live out our call to follow Christ.  Wherever you are on your spiritual journey, you are welcome here.  You do not have to join as a member in order to participate in worship services, service opportunities, or small group classes.  But if you are ready to make a deeper commitment to following Christ alongside your brothers and sisters here at Evangelical, church membership is an excellent way to follow your call.  For information on how to join, contact <a href="mailto:">Pastor David</a></p>
					<h4>Ways to Join</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Profession of faith</strong> — <em>a first-time commitment to Christ through the sacrament of baptism</em></li>
						<li><strong>Reaffirmation of faith</strong> — <em>a reaffirmation of your commitment to Christ</em>
</li>
						<li>Transfer of membership from another United Methodist church
</li>
						<li>Transfer of membership from another denomination
</li>
					</ul>

					<p><em>* If you have been baptized at any point in your life, it is not necessary to be baptized again. If not, baptism is a required part of joining the church.
	</em></p>
