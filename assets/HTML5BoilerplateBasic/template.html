			<header class="fossil">No Animals Were Harmed in the Making of This Fossil:</header>
			<h5 class="fossil">By: Sarah Fecht</h5>

				<p>The famous feathered dinosaur archaeopteryx seems to have had a penchant for fossilizing in painful positions, with its head cranked backward at a severe angle. The contorted posture is so common in dinosaur fossils that it has its own name: opisthotonus, from the Greek “tonos,” meaning tightening, and “opistho,” behind.</p>

				<p>Since the 1920s, paleontologists have debated how these dinosaurs came to have such grotesque final resting positions. Some theorized that water currents moved the bones into formation, or that the muscle contractions of rigor mortis pulled the head backward. Others thought the animals must have died in pain. </p>

				<header class="fossils">New research proposes a simpler explanation</header>

				<img src="fossil2.jpg" alt="fossil" class="right">

				<p class="float">In a paper published last month in the journal Palaeobiodiversity and Palaeoenvironments, Achim G. Reisdorf of the University of Basel in Switzerland writes that the trouble with the death-throe hypothesis is that carcasses are flexible. To fossilize in the traumatic death position, a carcass would have to be quickly buried in the exact spot where it died, without any transportation.</p>

				<p>But that is unlikely, Mr. Reisdorf wrote. Many of the dinosaurs found in opisthotonic posture are land animals that fell into sediment at the bottom of bodies of water, and probably had to settle before reaching their final resting place.</p>

				<p>Mr. Reisdorf thought water might be the key. So he and a colleague, Dr. Michael Wuttke, decided to try some kitchen science. They bought fresh chicken necks from a butcher and plunged them into water buckets.</p>

				<p>Immediately, the necks bent backward by 90 degrees. After three months and significant rotting, they had twisted further backward — to 140 degrees.</p>

			<header class="temple">The World's First Temple</header>
			<h5 class="temple">By: Sandra Scham</h5>

				<p>At first glance, the fox on the surface of the limestone pillar appears to be a trick of the bright sunlight. But as I move closer to the large, T-shaped megalith, I find it is carved with an improbable menagerie. A bull and a crane join the fox in an animal parade etched across the surface of the pillar, one of dozens erected by early Neolithic people at Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey. The press here is fond of calling the site "the Turkish Stonehenge," but the comparison hardly does justice to this 25-acre arrangement of at least seven stone circles. The first structures at Göbekli Tepe were built as early as 10,000 B.C., predating their famous British counterpart by about 7,000 years. </p>

				<p>The oldest man-made place of worship yet discovered, Göbekli Tepe is "one of the most important monuments in the world," says Hassan Karabulut, associate curator of the nearby Urfa Museum. He and archaeologist Zerrin Ekdogan of the Turkish Ministry of Culture guide me around the site. Their enthusiasm for the ancient temple is palpable. </p>

				<p>By the time of my visit in late summer, the excavation team lead by Klaus Schmidt of the German Archaeological Institute has wrapped up work for the season. But there is still plenty to see, including three excavated circles now protected by a large metal shelter. The megaliths, which may have once supported roofs, are about nine feet tall. </p>

				<p>Göbekli Tepe's circles range from 30 to 100 feet in diameter and are surrounded by rectangular stone walls about six feet high. Many of the pillars are carved with elaborate animal figure reliefs. In addition to bulls, foxes, and cranes, representations of lions, ducks, scorpions, ants, spiders, and snakes appear on the pillars. Freestanding sculptures depicting the animals have also been found within the circles. During the most recent excavation season, archaeologists uncovered a statue of a human and sculptures of a vulture's head and a boar. </p>

				<p>As we walk around the recently excavated pillars, the site seems at once familiar and exotic. I have seen stone circles before, but none like these. </p>
